  <h1>Website Comparison</h1>

  <h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
  
  <body>
    <p>
      <a>http://www.u2.com/index/home</a> 
      <a>http://www.u2.com/index/home </a></p> </body>

  <h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
  <body> 
<h3>http://www.u2.com/index/home</h3>
<h4>like:</h4>
<li>better than most band sites as is not as crowded as most</li>
<li>mobile friendly</li> 
<li>horizontal bands on homepage a nice way to manage info, but could be cleaner</li>
<li>nice to be met with a big photo of band right away</li>

<h4>do not like:</h4>
<li>navigation a bit crowded, should have less sections</li>
<li>subnavigation overkill, and at times overwhelming</li>
<li>feels like should be a lot more visually stark particularly as the band has gone back to basics, and their roots, so that a different visual treatment is called for</li>
<li>feels like the site is many pieces that have been built over time.  It is time for a complete overhaul and massive simplification</li>
<li>browsing by topic area is super dated</li>


<h3>http://wherehaveallthewildlingsgone.com/</h3>
<h4>like:</h4>
<li>faceless figures really allows you to focus on costumes and characters</li>
<li>nice clean navigation</li>
<li>takes a complicated plot and simplifies massively</li>
<li>like layers as you scroll down, as it feels methodical in a good way</li>
<li>Complex stuff made approachable and visually engaging</li>
<li>love use of costumes to describe a show/families, etc.</li>
<li>easy to scan, pleasant to read</li>
<li>nice visual variety between the figures, and text, a map, etc.</li>  
<li>use of bands created a nice sense of predictability</li>

<h4>do not like:</h4>
<li>not responsive when could work so nicely on mobile</li>
<li>do not like how navigation floats. like that stays with you, but becomes distracting and cheapens layout</li>
</body>

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
<body>
<li>use of horizontal bands</li>
<li>u2 does not have a clear mission (what does success look like here, ie satisfied fans, more downloads? more tickets?)</li>
<li>wildlings s super clear in mission and the designer's love for show comes out completely and the mission to simplify via great engaging visuals</li>
